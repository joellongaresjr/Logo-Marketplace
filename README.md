# User Stories

- As a user I want to see different products complete with the name image and description and a navbar that allows the user to search, view cart and login/signup. So that I can see which products I'd like to purchase, be able to login or sign up, search for a specific item, and see items I plan to buy in my cart.

- As a user I want to create a new account so that I can purchase products and save my shipping information. So that it will be stored and will not be required to fill out additional times if I choose to make multiple purchases.

- As a user I want to have a logout and account links in the header. So that I can logout if needed and review past orders I have made.

- As a user When I click on the search bar autofill items display as I type. So that I have an easier time searching for the products that I am searching for

- As a user When I click an Item I am taken to product page that will display the full details of the item and be able to specify an amount that I want . So that I can get more information about any item and be able to put and amount of the item before I add it to my cart.

- As a user When I click the checkout I am presented with a detailed breakdown of the Items I have selected with the associated cost and am given the options to edit items amounts or remove items. So that I can edit my cart right before I finalize my purchase

- As a user After item amounts are confirmed by the user, they are presented with a Stripe form to fill out shipping and payment information. So that I can submit my purchase.
